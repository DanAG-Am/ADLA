        <h2>Workflow in Github and Git</h2>
        <p>Knowing the workflow enables you to track your projects and collaborate with others efficiently. Let's go through some github commands that take your remote repository to a local one and vice-versa.</p>
        
        <h3>Commands in Git:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><code>git init</code>: Initialize a new repository.</li>
            <li><code>git clone [url]</code>: Clone a repository locally.</li>
            <li><code>git status</code>: Show the status of different files (if you added, deleted or committed any).</li>
            <li><code>git add [file]</code>: Add files to the staging area</li>
            <li><code>git commit -m "message"</code>: Commit the files in the staging area, as well as add a message to describe to yourself or your team what the changes are about.</li>
            <li><code>git push</code>: Upload your changes to the remote repository</li>
            <li><code>git pull</code>: Bring the changes from the remote repository into the local one.</li>
            <li><code>git branch</code>: Show any existing branches in your repository.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The same commands apply when working on a branch and pushing or pulling changes from it. Now, this is just a basic workflow. Lets take a look at how we can do different things in github to bring a repository to life.</p>

        <h2>Features in Github</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the features that you can use in github to make your workflow more appealing.</p>
        <h3>Features:</h3>
        <p>Github allows you to implement code, image from the repository or external sources, lists and different semantic features just like in html, such as headers. <br> You will mostly find such type of text in a README file, which describes the repository and the code implementation.</br></p>

        <p>Github also allows you to track branches, check suggested workflow and the distribution of the programming languages found in your repository</p>

        <h3>Deploying a web page</h3>
        <p>Recently, we learned how to turn a repository or a specific file found within the same onto a web page. This is specially useful when you need to deploy your personal portfolio, for example.</p>
