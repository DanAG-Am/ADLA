            <p>Frogs have specialized skin that allows them to breathe through it, making them one of the few animals that can absorb oxygen both through their lungs and their skin.</p>

            <p>Frogs can jump incredibly long distances for their size, with some species able to leap over 20 times their body length!</p>

            <p>Some frogs can freeze and survive winter â€” certain species, like the wood frog, can actually freeze solid during cold months and thaw out in the spring, continuing to live.</p>

            <p>Frogs have a unique way of eating: They use their eyes to help swallow food. When they swallow, their eyes sink into their skulls to push the food down their throat.</p>

            <p>Frogs have no tails as adults, but they do have tails when they are tadpoles. Their tails disappear during metamorphosis.</p>
